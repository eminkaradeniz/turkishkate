Hello you all guys, I am Emin, I'm physical therapist and technology lover so I combined these two stuff and burned Turkish Kate(temporary name). My purpose is that Kate will be a voice assistant like Siri, Alexa or Google Assistant You'll be able to ask her for example I have back pain what should I do ? or I have a tennis elbow what can I do ? And also she has British accent which is my love :) These codes are also basic and I'll add some Javascript codes for to do list. I'm gonna share my first update when I complete my first three diseases such as back pain, impingement syndrome and plantar fasciitis.

Thank You Guys Keep You Safe !
